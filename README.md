# README: Data Analysis for Urban Planning

## Course Overview
This course focuses on finding and analyzing datasets in the context of urban planning and research. Students will learn advanced quantitative and statistical methods, leveraging Python as the main platform for data manipulation and statistical analysis. The course emphasizes real-world applications, including data from NYC’s open data catalog.

## Prerequisites
Students should have:
- Basic computer literacy, including file management and cloud-based backups (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive).
- Basic mathematical knowledge and experience with MS Excel for data manipulation.
- A willingness to troubleshoot programming problems independently.
- An understanding that generative AI will be used in the course.

## Course Tools
- **Communication Platform:** Email and Discord 
- **Programming Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Anaconda, VS Code
- **Main Programming Language:** Python

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
1. Find and work with online datasets and open data catalogs.
2. Use basic statistics to interpret data.
3. Model relationships using linear regression.
4. Build foundational Python programming skills for data analysis and visualization.
5. Critically analyze planning policies using data.
6. Collaborate with peers to solve urban issues with data.
